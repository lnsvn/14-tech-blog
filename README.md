## Usage

When you first open the site, you are taken to the homepage. Within the homepage, you can view posts that other developers have published, and you can click on these posts to see what others have commented on them. Before you can create your own posts or add any comments, you must login or sign up. Once you have done so, you will have access to your own dashboard where you can create, update, or delete your posts, and you'll have the ability to make comments on the homepage. If you are away from the site for more than five minutes, you will be prompted to login in again.
